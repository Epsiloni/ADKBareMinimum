# ADK Bare Minimum Project
## Rewritten by Assaf Gamliel (goo.gl/E2MhJ) (assafgamliel.com).
### Based on Simon Monk code.

Feel free to contact me with any question, I hope I can help.
This code should give you a good jump start with your Android and Arduino project.

This is the minimum you need to communicate between your Android device and your Arduino device.
If needed I'll upload the example I made (Sonar distance measureing device).
